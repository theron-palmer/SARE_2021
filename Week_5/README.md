# Part 1: Poster Methods and Materials

The first portion of this week will be spent creating the methods and materials section for the SARE 2021 poster. This will entail a figure explaining the pipeline and summaries of the tools used within the pipeline.

The papers describing the MHCnuggets tool and the Leafcutter tool are included in the current directory. Using these you can make a general description of the tools. You do not need to understand the math or computation involved in either tools's methods. All we want is a description of what each tool does. 

A first draft mockup of the overall methods figure is included in the directory as a .png file.
